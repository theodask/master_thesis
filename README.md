## Overview

This repository contains the bioinformatic analysis performed for my Master's thesis investigating the role of GemC1 in regulating chromatin dynamics and transcriptional programs during the differentiation of multiciliated ependymal cells.

Using CUT&RUN, CUT&Tag, and transcriptomic data, this project explores how loss of GemC1 reshapes chromatin remodeling, alters Polycomb-mediated repression, and disrupts gene regulatory networks essential for multiciliogenesis.


## Biological Background

Multiciliated cells are specialized epithelial cells that generate coordinated ciliary motion to facilitate fluid movement in tissues such as the brain ventricles and respiratory tract. Defects in their formation are associated with severe human diseases, including ciliopathies and hydrocephalus.

GemC1 is a transcriptional activator known to control early steps of multiciliated cell differentiation. However, the chromatin-level mechanisms through which GemC1 cooperates with remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF (BAF) remain poorly understood.

This project aims to characterize these mechanisms through genome-wide analyses.


## Methods Overview

Tools and approaches used include:

- Bash-based sequencing data processing  
- Peak calling and genomic annotation  
- Differential analysis  
- GREAT for gene–region associations  
- Enrichr for functional enrichment  
- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)  
- Integrative chromatin interpretation
